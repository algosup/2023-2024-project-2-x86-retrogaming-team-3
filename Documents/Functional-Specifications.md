## Overview

### Task and Objective
#### Task
<!--- Explain what we have to do -->
Our team was tasked with doing a Pac-Man clone. With the added restriction that it has to be coded in assembly and run on a x86 CPU architecture 16bit system. We are allowed to be creative with our implementation of Pac-Man.

#### Goal and Vision
<!-- our end goal with this project -->


### What is Pac-Man ?
<!-- Explain what is pacman + image to be pretty -->
Pac-Man is a maze arcade game created in 1980 in Japan. In the game you play Pac-Man who look like : <img src="./pictures/pac-man1.png" alt="a yellow ball with a mouth" width="15"/>, and need to eat all the Gums in a maze to end the level. <p align="center"><img src="./pictures/PAC-MAN-game1.png" alt="pac-man game" width="400"/></p> 
In this picture, the smallest dot in the maze are Gums. To navigate the level you can go up, down, left or right, with no other input required<br>
Multi-coulored ghosts <img src="./pictures/pink-ghost.png" alt="pink-ghost" width="15"/> are chassing Pac-Man through the level and if one touch Pac-Man, he lose a life.<br> Pac-Man can eat a Super Gum (The slightly bigger dots) they give Pac-Man the ability to eat the ghost for a period of time. When you compleet a level, the ghost get faster and the Super Gum bonus get shorter. <br> After a set amount of time, fruits appear in a level. Eating the fruits give bonus points. <br>

## Glossaire

fruit : In the original Pac-Man, the fruits are located below the Ghost House and won't move at all. The fruit appears after 70 dots are eaten and again after 170 dots are eaten unless the first fruit is still there. They will disappear if they are not eaten after 9-10 seconds.
