    ![image.png](./pictures/retroplan.png)
    (do agile instead of waterfall) => use scrum methodology

    - #### Milestones

    | Milestone | Deadline |
    |---|---|
    | Functional Specifications V1 | Friday, November 10th 2023 |
    | Technical Specifications V1 | |
    | POC (pre MVP) | |
    | MVP (Alpha realease) | |
    | Oral Presentation (Beta Release) | |
    | ?? | |

    - #### Dependencies

    The POC requires some prior understanding of the target technologies before being developed, meaning that its development will probably start on week 2.

    The MVP requires the POC to be made first to estimate difficulty of tasks and viability of set objectives.

    The rest of the project depends on the first version of the functional specifications to be released and approved first.

    We have an estimated 55 hours total to complete this project
    => We have the team

    => Teachers

    => School's resources
