### Week Feedback

The team's feeling is geting a bit down as we don't think we are making as much progress as we were during the last weeks. The facts the we didn't had much project time and the some members were absent isn't helping.

### Progression Overview

This progression is calculated using done and remaining KPIs. The coefficient of each KPI was discussed and set by the team after deliberation.
