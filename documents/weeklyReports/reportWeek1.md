### Week Feedback

The overall feeling of the team is that we struggled a bit to get started but we are now on the right path. Everyone has a pretty good feeling about the theme of the project and our current progression. We tackled task assignments and did a detailed analysis of the requirements along with our own objectives for this project.

Even if we are a bit late on the schedule compared to what our objective was for this week, the team and I think that we should be able to catch up to it and get back on track as soon as next week.

### Progression Overview

This progression is calculated using done and remaining KPIs. The coefficient of each KPI was discussed and set by the team after deliberation.
