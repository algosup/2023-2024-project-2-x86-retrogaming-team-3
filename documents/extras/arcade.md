Project x86-retrogaming -- Team 3
---

<h2 align="center">Bar-Top Arcade</h2>

### Context

Within the project "x86-retrogaming" made for ALGOSUP, we thought as a team that it would be great to have a real arcade machine to complete the PAC-MAN clone. From this idea we thought of building one ourselves, this document regroups all information relative to the arcade machine.

### HardWare

For the hardware we decided to go with a Raspberry PI 3 as it was an easy-to-set-up and cheap solution combined with an old screen to keep the look retro.

### Dimensions

The Bar-Top Arcade will be built following "The Wood Whisperer" 's tutorial. He provided cutting plans and steps to follow which will help us save time on the building.

### Materials

For the case materials we decided to go with wood as it is cheap  and easy to shape. It should also give a great look to the arcade.

Since we re-used some old components that members of the team owned, we were able to cut some costs mainly for the screen and cables.
