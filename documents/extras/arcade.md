Project x86-retrogaming -- Team 3
---

<h2 align="center">Bar-Top Arcade</h2>

### Context

Within the project "x86-retrogaming" made for ALGOSUP, we thought as a team that it would be great to have a real arcade machine to complete the PAC-MAN clone. From this idea we thought of building one ourselves, this document regroup all informations relative to the arcade machine.

### HardWare

For the hardware we decided to go with a RaspBerry PI 3 as it was an easy to set up and cheap solution combined with an old screen to keep the look retro.

### Dimensions

The Bar-Top Arcade will be built following a specific plan which you can find bellow

[insert plan]

### Materials

For the materials we decided to go with wood as it is cheap and easy to shape. It should also give a great look to the arcade.

Since we re-used some old components that members of the team were owning, we were able to cut some cost mainly for the screen and cables.
